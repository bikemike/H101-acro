# Floureon H101 and Eachine H8S acro firmware ( red board )

*now with dual mode as well*

__DO NOT ACCIDENTALLY FLASH THE H8MINI FIRMWARE TO THE H101__ (it may break it)


Select folder for the correct firmware:
* __H101_Acro__: Acro mode
* __H101_dual__: Acro + Level mode

Note for H101_dual code: By default motor direction is automatically set at takeoff / zero-throttle, based on orientation.


For programming the ground pad is marked (B-) on the pcb(near the edge) .It is also close to some other components. Note there is also a (B+) pad,do not connect this. 

It works with Devo, stock or H8 mini tx.

You could also use diy [nrf24_multipro](https://github.com/goebish/nrf24_multipro) module by Goebish or [DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module) which supports telemetry.

 * GigaDevice GD32F130G6 cortex-M3 32k
 * Invensense gyro + accelerometer
 * XN297 transceiver
 * 8 Nfets and 8 Pfets. The P fets are controlled together in 2 groups of 4.


Cpu datasheet: [Pdf](https://app.box.com/s/3zi661iffmit1rwda499wu8vycv03biv) Cpu Documentation: [Pdf](https://app.box.com/s/pehsanvluc40qu8k2036sbjk5ti08y2m)

The firmware needs Keil.GD32F1xx_DFP.1.1.0.pack which adds support for the cpu to Keil (5.15 used). Later Keil versions will ask for the pack to be installed if not present, and will download it automatically.


The firmware flash procedure is the same as the H8.

### Changing settings

__config.h__ - all settings: rates, switches/buttons config, other options

__pid.c__ - pids ( tuned for standard H101)

__angle_pid.c__ (*dual mode only*) level mode pid, also uses acro pids in level mode, so it should fly ok in acro mode first.


After changing settings, remember to click compile first, not just upload.

### Stock tx:
On the stock tx only the rate (expert) button works. Trims are not functional on the stock tx, but the buttons can be used for controlling functions such as acro / level switch.

### Devo tx:
Channels work as intended except the rate/expert channel which is always on. Dynamic trims are not used, and trims should not be required.

Assign the extra channels to the desired functions in config.h. A setting such as "#define LEVELMODE DEVO_CHAN_9" could be used, for example.

### Gyro calibration
Gyro calibration runs automatically after power up, and usually completes within 2-4 seconds. If for some reason the calibration fails to complete, such as if there is movement, it will eventually time out in 15 seconds.

During calibration the leds glow from low brightness to high brightness. If movement is detected the flashing stops. The flashing resumes when movement stops.

*The quad should be standing still during gyro calibration for best results*


### Accelerometer calibration ***(level mode only)***
For accelerometer calibration move the pitch stick down 3 times within about 1- 2 seconds. Wait a couple of seconds after a failed attempt. Throttle has to be low, and roll centered. Flashing lights indicate the calibration process. This is saved so it has to be done only once.

Note, the acc calibration also saves gyro biases which are used in some cases. The flash pattern is similar to the gyro calibration pattern.

*Calibration has to be done on a horizontal surface*

### Led error codes
In some cases the leds are used to indicate error conditions, and as such they flash a number of times, then a brake occurs, then the pattern repeats. In all such cases the quadcopter will not respond to commands, a power cycle will be required.

The most common of this is 2 flashes = low battery, usually caused by an in-flight reset due to low battery. All other flashes are non user serviceable. The description is in main.c.

### Led flash patterns
At startup the leds should flash a gyro calibration pattern for 2 - 15 seconds, with a glow like pattern. Movement stops the flashing while it occurs.

Following should be a fast (20 times/sec) flash indicating that the quad is waiting for bind. 

If binding is completed the leds should light up continuously, while if tx connection is lost they will flash a short time a couple of times / second.

Overriding all this patterns except gyro calibration, is the low battery flash which is a slow, equally spaced on and off flash. 

### Level / acro mode change
By default "gestures" are used to change modes, move the stick *left-left-down* for acro mode , and *right-right-down* for level mode.

### Pid gestures and save
Pid gestures allow the pilot to change the acro mode pids by a percentage, and such tune the quadcopter without a computer. The new pids can be saved so that they will be restored after the quad is power cycled.The new pids will remain active if saved, until the pid values in file pid.c are changed. If the values are not changed, flashing the quad will not erase the pids unless the erase command is manually issued when programming.

### Accel calibration / pid save
The gesture for accel calibration is down - down - down. If pids have been changed using the respective gestures since the last powerup or save, the pids will be saved instead.

### Telemetry
DeviationTx and multimodule+taranis can support telemetry, this requires no changes from the defaults on the quad. For devo, when selecting the Bayang protocol, hit Enter to see options, and enable telemetry there. Telemetry currently contains received number of data and telemetry packets, and 2 voltages, battery raw voltage and compensated voltage ( against voltage drop )

For multimodule, you need to add telemetry ( as an option ) to the bayang protocol in the protocol table ( configuration file ). Note the telemetry protocol won't work with stock quads.

### Android App telemetry
The Android app "SilverVISE" by SilverAG (not me) is able to receive telemetry from the quad using BLE packets. To use, the app protocol should be set in the quadcopter. The app will also show the pids.
